        description: ` The sociable lapwing (Vanellus gregarius) belongs to the family of plovers, dotterels
        and lapwings, Charadriidae.The lapwing was given its name following observations of the species
        gathering in large flocks during migration. The Sociable Lapwing is part of the Lapwing genus
        Vanellus, which diverged from
        all other species of birds 28 million years ago! The Sociable Lapwing is a steppe specialist. Their
        wandering nature may have evolved in order to find the short vegetation they prefer to nest in,
        which is associated with migratory grazing animals.`,
        range:  `The sociable lapwing species is distributed in India, Pakistan, central
        and southwest Asia, Arabian Peninsula and northeast Africa. This species breeds in Kazakhstan and
        Russia and disperses through to Kyrgzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan Turkmenistan, Afghanistan,
        Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey and Egypt, to key wintering
        sites in Sudan, Pakistan and India. Individuals have been recorded in many unexpected places well outside their normal
        range including the Maldives and even Essex in the UK.`,
        diet:`  The diet of sociable lapwing consists mainly of insects. Insects, caterpillars, beetles,
        grasshoppers, cicadas, spiders, scorpions and crickets are their primary food.
        These lapwings also feed on seeds, grains, leaves and flowers. These species forage on the ground,
        picking insects and other small prey. Ploughed fields and grasslands are their favorite feeding
        grounds.`,
        breeding: `The breeding season of the sociable lapwing species is from April to July in most of their breeding
        range. These birds are monogamous and breed in small colonies.
        The nesting sites of sociable lapwing are usually located near water on bare saline plains or on
        short vegetation. The nest is a scrape, which may be bare or lined with twigs, grass and pebbles.
        The lapwing clutch contains three to four pale buff, ovoid eggs with dark olive brown mottling. The
        breeding pair take turns to incubate the eggs. The chicks hatch out after 25 days. The parents brood
        the chicks. The chicks are precocial and are able feed themselves.`,
        conservation: ` The global population size of the sociable lapwing (Vanellus gregarius) is estimated to number
        16,000 to 17,000 individual birds. The overall population trend of the species is considered to be
        decreasing.
        Throughout its range, the lapwing species is reported to be very rare to locally uncommon. The
        generation length is 9 years. Its distribution size is about 1,670,000 sq.km.
        Habitat alteration and destruction, expanding agricultural and aquaculture activities and hunting
        are the main threats that are endangering the survival of this lapwing species.`

        description: `Jerdon’s Courser is a nocturnal, cursorial bird endemic to India– it is mostly active
        at night,
        and like lapwings and other coursers, it prefers to walk, although it can fly quite well. It is
        one of three species in the genus Rhinoptilus, with the other two species (Three-banded Courser
        Rhinoptilus cinctus and Bronze-winged Courser Rhinoptilus chalcopterus) occurring in Africa.`,
        range: `Jerdon’s Courser was first recorded by <i><strong>Thomas C. Jerdon</strong></i>, a British surgeon,
        in 1848, from erstwhile
        combined Andra Pradesh. One of the historical records from 1867 placed the bird close to Sironcha,
        which now falls in Maharashtra; another placed it in the Bhadrachalam region which falls in the
        newly formed Telangana state.
        It has a very limited habitat, in southern Andhra Pradesh. Fom the Godaveri river
        valley near Sironcha and Bhadrachalam, and from the Cuddapah and Anantapur areas in the valley of
        the Pennar river. Jerdon did think that the bird had a much wider range than this and it even was
        present in parts of Madhya Pradesh, but at present it remains known only from the vicinity of the
        Lankamalai, Velikonda and Palakonda ranges in the Pennar valley, Cuddapah district, Andhra Pradesh.`,
        diet: ` The diet of these Jerdon's courser species is mostly insects. It is a nocturnal bird, foraging among
        bushes for slow moving insects like termites. Jerdon's courser feed at night.`,
        breeding: `The breeding season of these Jerdon's courser species is not known. A male with developed gonads was
        collected in June; may be indicative of breeding period. The typical clutch contains one or two
        speckled, pale yellow eggs.`,

        description: ` The Siberian crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) is a large bird belonging to the crane family,
        Gruidae. They occur in three groups: the eastern group, which migrates from eastern Siberia to
        China, the central group, which migrates from western Siberia to India, and the western group, which
        migrate from western Russia to Iran.
        Adult Siberian cranes are 140 cm (5 ft) tall and weight 6 kg (13 lbs).[2] Their plumage is pure
        white, except for some wing feathers, which are black. The front of the face does not have any
        feathers and is reddish in color.`,
        range: ` Siberian cranes are spread throughout three populations: western, eastern, and central. These
        distinct populations range from Yakutia in arctic Russia to western Siberia. The population in the
        east breeds in northeast Siberia and migrates to China to the Yangtze River for winter. The central
        population of cranes breeds in western Siberia then migrates to Rajasthan in India for winter,
        mainly at the Keoladeo National Park. The population in the west spends winter in Iran on the
        Caspian sea's southern coast and breeds in Russia's northwest. These cranes feed and nest primarily
        in marshes, bogs and other wetlands where there are wide reaches of shallow fresh water with good
        visibility. They live mainly in lowland tundra, taiga biogeographic, and taiga/tundra transition
        regions.`,
        diet: `  The primary diet of these crane species is plant matter like roots, rhizomes, submerged leaves,
        seeds, bulbs, tubers, aquatic plants and sprouts. When the vegetation is covered by snow, the diet
        of crane shifts to food of animal origin like insects, fish, birds, rodents and other small animals.`,
        breeding: ` These crane species usually breed during late May to mid-June in Russia. Large nest of 50 to 80 cm
        diameter is constructed with grass and sedge near water. Normally two eggs are laid. The female
        crane incubates the eggs and the male stands guard nearby. Only one chick survives due to aggression
        between the fledglings.`,
        conservation: ` These Siberian crane species global population is estimated to be around 3,500 to 4,000 individual
        birds. They are legally protected in all the eleven range states under CITES (the Convention on
        International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).The overall population trend is considered to be alarming. They are Critically
        Endangered. The loss of wetlands and marshes due to human activities, hunting, poisoning, pollution
        from oil and petroleum are the threats to the survival of these crane species.`

        name: 'Bengal Florican',
        scientific_name: 'Vanellus gregarius',
        img1:'assets/images/main/florican1.jpg',
        description: `  Adult Bengal floricans range from 66–68 cm in length and stand around 55 cm
        tall. The male has black plumage from the head and neck to underparts. Its head carries a long
        lanky crest, and the neck has elongated display plumes. The upperside is buff with fine black
        vermiculations and black arrowhead markings, and there is a conspicuous large white patch from the
        wing coverts to the remiges. In flight, the male's wings appear entirely white except for the dark
        primary remiges. The feet and legs are yellow, the bill and irides are dark. They are normally
        silent but when disturbed utters a metallic chik-chik-chik call. Displaying males croak and produce
        a strange deep humming.`,
        range:  ` Bengal Florican has two disjunct populations, one in the Indian subcontinent, another in Southeast
        Asia. The
        former occurs from Uttar Pradesh (India) through the Terai of Nepal to Assam (where it is called ulu
        mora) and Arunachal Pradesh in India, and historically to Bangladesh. The South East Asian
        population occurs in Cambodia and perhaps adjacent southern Vietnam.ian subcontinent; its
        largest populations are found in the Indian state of Rajasthan.`,
        diet:`  The Bengal florican birds are omnivorous and feed on seeds, berries, plant matter, insects, other
        invertebrates and small vertebrates.`,
        breeding: ` The breeding season of these florican birds is from March to August and males make stunning
        courtship display. The clutch may contain one or two eggs. The female florican incubates the eggs
        and raises the chicks.`,
        conservation: ` A very rapid decline in the global population of Bengal florican is estimated to have occurred over
        the last three generations and the total global population may be 350-1,500 individual birds. The
        major threats to conservation of these florican species are habitat loss through modification of
        grasslands, agriculture and plantation activities, overgrazing, inappropriate cutting, burning of
        grasslands, heavy flooding and dam construction.`

        name: 'Himalayan quail',
        scientific_name: 'Ophrysia superciliosa',
        img1:'assets/images/main/florican1.jpg',
        description: `  The Himalayan quail or mountain quail, is a medium-sized quail belonging to the pheasant family. It
        was last reported in 1876 and is feared extinct. This species was known from only 2 locations in the
        western Himalayas in Uttarakhand, north-west India. The last verifiable record was in 1876 near the
        hill station of Mussoorie.
        The red bill and legs of this small dark quail and white spots before and after the eye make it
        distinctive. The male is dark grey with bleak streaks and a white forehead and supercilium. The
        female is brownish with dark streaks and greyish brow. Like the male it has a white spot in front of
        the eye and a larger one behind the eye.[3] It is believed to fly only when flushed at close
        quarters and was found in coveys of five or six. The habitat was steep hillsides covered by long
        grass.`,
        range:  `  Himalayan quail is found only in the mountains of Uttarakhand in North-west Himalayas where about a
        dozen specimens were collected near Mussoorie and Nainital prior to 1877. Field observations during
        the mid-19th century suggest that it may have been relatively common but it was rare by the late
        1800s, indicating at population decline.`,
        diet:`  They are extremely elusive and reluctant to fly. They only fly when just about to be stepped on.
        Himalayan quail feed on the seeds of grasses and probably berries and insects.`,
        breeding: ` It was only recorded around Mussoorie and Naini Tal hill stations during the winter months,
        suggesting it may breed at higher altitudes.`,
        conservation: `  Habitat degradation has taken place due to increased pressure from
        anthropogenic factors like land-use change (limestone mining) and
        deforestation. Also, tourism has served as an additional factor responsible for
        the deterioration of the habitat.
        Pre-independence hunting is another likely factor that has resulted in the
        decline and possible extinction of this species.
        Conservation practices:
        Attempts of sighting the bird and confirming its presence in and around Mussoorie
        and Nainital have proved unsuccessful though the species was reported in Nainital in
        2003. Unofficial and official searches, with local participation have been conducted
        but the results have been insufficient.
        It is also hypothesized that habitat changes at lower elevations during the post Pleistocene
        glaciation might have pushed sub-populations to sub-optimal higher elevations causing local
        extinctions.`

        name: `Indian Bustard`,
        scientific_name: `Ardeotis nigriceps`,
        img1:`assets/images/main/bustard2.jpg`,
        description: ` The great Indian bustard is a large ground bird with a height of about one metre. It is unmistakable
        with its black cap contrasting with the pale head and neck. The body is brownish with a black patch
        spotted in white. The male is deep sandy buff coloured and during the breeding season has a black
        breast band. The crown of the head is black and crested and is puffed up by displaying males. In the
        female which is smaller than the male, the head and neck are not pure white and the breast band is
        either rudimentary, broken or absent.`,
        range: ` The great Indian bustard inhabits dry grasslands and scrublands on the Indian subcontinent; its
        largest populations are found in the Indian state of Rajasthan.`,
        diet: ` The species is omnivorous, taking different foods in differing seasons. In northwestern Spain in
        August, 48.4% of the diet of adult birds was green plant material, 40.9% was invertebrates and 10.6%
        was seeds. In the same population during winter, seeds and green plant material constituted almost
        the entirety of the diet. Alfalfa is seemingly preferred in the diet of birds from Spain. Other
        favoured plant life in the diet can including legumes, crucifers, common dandelion and grapes and
        the dry seeds of wheat and barley. Among animal prey, insects are generally eaten and are the
        main food for young bustards in their first summer, though they then switch to the seasonal
        herbivorous preferences of adults by winter. Coleoptera (including beetles), Hymenoptera (including
        bees, wasps and ants) and Orthoptera (including crickets, grasshoppers and locusts) are mainly
        taken, largely based on availability and abundance. Small vertebrates, including small rodents,
        frogs, lizards and chicks of other birds, may supplement the diet when the opportunity
        arises. Great bustards may eat toxic blister beetles of the genus Meloe to self-medicate
        (Zoopharmacognosy) increasing sexual arousal of males.`,
        breeding: ` The great bustard breeds in March, and a single male may mate with up to five females.
        One to three olive or tan coloured, glossy eggs (two eggs being the average) are laid by the female
        in May or June. The nests, which are shallow scrapes made by the female on dry, soft slopes and
        plains, are usually situated close to the prior lek location.
        The nesting sites of sociable lapwing are usually located near water on bare saline plains or on
        short vegetation. The nest is a scrape, which may be bare or lined with twigs, grass and pebbles.`,
        conservation: ` There are myriad threats faced by great bustards. Increasing human disturbance could lead to habitat
        loss caused by the ploughing of grasslands, intensive agriculture, afforestation, increased
        development of irrigation schemes, and the construction of roads, power lines, fencing and ditches.
        Mechanisation, chemical fertilizers and pesticides, fire and predation by dogs are serious threats
        for chicks and juveniles, and hunting of adults contributes to high mortality in some of their range
        countries. Agricultural activity is a major disturbance at nest and, in Hungary, few successful
        nests are found outside of protected areas.`

        to Delhi, east through Madhya Pradesh, south to the Nilgiris, and occasionally further south (Collar
        et al. 2001). The species was first recorded in Nepal in 2011 (Subedi and DeCandido 2013). It was
        common until very recently, but since the mid-1990s has suffered a catastrophic decline (over 97%)
        throughout its range.`,
        diet: ` These bird species are scavengers, feeding mostly from carcasses of dead animals. By soaring high,
        these birds spot the dead animals.`,
        breeding: ` It breeds mainly on hilly crags in central and peninsular India. These bird species nest mainly on
        cliffs. In rare cases they have been observed to nest on tall trees. Both the parents take part in

        conservation: `There is a sharp decline in the population of these bird species and they are considered 'critically
        endangered'. Kidney failure in vultures caused by feeding on carcasses of animals treated with
        diclofenac (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) was the major cause of sudden decline in
        populations. Nearly 97% of the population was lost in 1990s. Present threats to the their
        conservations and survival are degradation of the habitats, human disturbances of breeding pairs and
        inadequate food availability.`

        Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand. It also winters locally from SE India and Sri Lanka to Indochina
        and S China, and S to Singapore and Philippines. The bird breeds in northeastern Russia along the
        Chukotsk and
        Kamchatka Peninsula. During winter, it migrates down the Pacific coast of Russia and the Southeast
        Asia.`,
        diet: ` Spoon-billed sandpipers feed on insects and other small invertebrates
        such as worms. On the breeding ground, they feed on a variety of larval and adult invertebrates such
        as midges, beetles, and spiders. The spoon-billed sandpiper also feeds on some of the plant material
        such as grass seeds and berries. During winter and migration, the birds feed on a variety of marine
        invertebrates such as polychaete worms and shrimps. Spoon-billed sandpipers walk through shallows
        and wet meadows with their heads down and bills moving side to side during foraging. Their feeding
        ground includes mudflats and saltpans where invertebrate preys are common.`,
        breeding: `The breeding season takes place in June-July. The Spoon-billed Sandpiper nests on the ground, among
        mosses, sedges and creeping osiers. The shallow depression is lined with leaves, usually of dwarf
        willows. This species produces a single brood per season, but a replacement clutch is usually laid
        if the first brood is lost.`,
        conservation: `  The Spoon-billed Sandpiper is threatened by habitat loss through changes and degradation in the
        habitat for industry, aquaculture and wind farms (in Asia). Illegal hunting, pollution and human
        disturbance at nesting sites often involve high levels of nest desertion, and the natural predation
        affects the small population.
        The global population is estimated at 240/400 mature individuals, equating to 360/600 individuals in
        total, but it is probably smaller than this estimate.
        The Spoon-billed Sandpiper is listed as Critically Endangered with still declining population.`

        description: `The sociable lapwing (Vanellus gregarius) belongs to the family of plovers, dotterels
        and lapwings, Charadriidae.The lapwing was given its name following observations of the species
        gathering in large flocks during migration. The Sociable Lapwing is part of the Lapwing genus
        Vanellus, which diverged from
        all other species of birds 28 million years ago! The Sociable Lapwing is a steppe specialist. Their
        wandering nature may have evolved in order to find the short vegetation they prefer to nest in,
        which is associated with migratory grazing animals.`,
        range: `The white-bellied heron is found in the wetlands of tropical and subtropical forests in the
        foothills of the eastern Himalayas of India and Myanmar. It also occurs in Bhutan's sub-tropical
        areas and was once found in Nepal. The major threats the heron faces are poaching (both the bird
        itself and its eggs) and habitat destruction (cutting of nesting trees and the disappearance of
        wetlands).
        In Bhutan, white-bellied herons are found along the Punatsang Chu river especially in Pho-chhu river
        banks in Toewang Gewog, along Kami Chhu river) and in Lower Kheng (Berti).`,
        diet: ` The white-bellied sea eagle feeds on fish, turtles and water snakes and crustaceans. It also feeds
        on small mammals, reptiles, birds and carrion. It is known for snatching feed from other birds.`,
        breeding: `  The white-bellied sea eagle breeds during the dry season in its range. The nest is built on tall
        trees, cliffs or man-made pylons. The nest is constructed with sticks and branches and is lined with
        grass or seaweed. The clutch may have two eggs, but usually only one chick is reared successfully to
        fledging. Both the sea eagle parents take part in incubation and rearing of the chick.`,
        conservation: `The white-bellied sea eagle global population is estimated to number 10,000 to 100,000 individual
        birds. These white-bellied sea eagle species have an extremely large range, and hence considered not
        vulnerable. The sea eagle population is under decline due breeding habitat loss caused by the
        clearance of water-edge vegetations. Shooting, poisoning and human activity near breeding sites are
        the threats to their survival.`
