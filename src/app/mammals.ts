        description: `The Bengal tiger is sometimes known as the Royal Bengal tiger and is a subspecies of tiger. It is the national animal of India and Bangladesh. 
        The Bengal tiger is the second largest and the most common tiger subspecies.
        Bengal tigers are mostly solitary, however, they sometimes travel in groups of 3 or 4 individuals. Bengal tigers reside in the low-land parts of the rainforest where there are grasslands and swamps.`,
        range: `The Bengal tiger is primarily found in Bangladesh, India and also in Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and in southern Tibet.
        The Bengal tiger inhabits in grasslands, subtropical and tropical rainforests (mostly Asian rainforests), scrub forests, wet and dry deciduous forests and mangroves.`,
        diet: `Bengal tigers are carnivores which means they eat meat rather than plants. 
        Bengal tigers hunt medium-sized and large-sized animals, such as wild boar, sambar, barasingha , chital , nilgai , gaur (a large ox of South Asia) and water buffalo.
        Bengal tigers sometimes prey on smaller animals like hares, monkeys or peacocks and carrion (the carcass of a dead animal). 
        Bengal tigers have also been known to prey on young Asian Elephants and rhino calves in rare cases.   
        Bengal tigers have also been known to take other predators such as leopards, wolves, jackals, foxes, crocodiles and dholes (a species of wild dog) as prey, although these predators are not typically a part of the Bengal tigers diet`,
        breeding: `A female Bengal tiger usually has her first cubs at about 3 or 4 years old. Gestation for a female tiger usually lasts about 3 or 4 months. After this time she gives birth to an average litter of about 2 to 5 cubs.
         It is not unusual though to have as many as 6, or only one. Newborn cubs are blind at birth and weigh about 2 or 3 pounds.`,
        conservation:`Bengal tigers are an ‘endangered species’. 
        The current population of wild Bengal tigers in the Indian subcontinent is now estimated to be around 1300 – 1500.
        Habitat loss and poaching are important threats to species survival. Poachers kill tigers not only for their pelts (coats), but also for components to make various traditional East Asian medicines. Other factors contributing to their loss are urbanization and revenge killing. Revenge killing occurs as locals such as farmers who own livestock hunt down the tigers to prevent them from preying on their cattle.
         Poachers also kill tigers for their bones and teeth to make medicines that are alleged to provide the tigers strength.`
